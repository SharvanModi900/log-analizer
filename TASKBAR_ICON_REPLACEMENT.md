# How to Replace the Default Electron Icon in the Taskbar

## Current Status
- Your custom icon design (without text) is ready in `icon.svg`
- The application is configured to use `build/icons/win/icon.ico`
- Currently using a placeholder that won't display in the taskbar

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Create a Proper PNG File
1. Open `convert-svg-to-png.html` in your browser
2. Click the "Convert to PNG" button
3. Right-click on the converted image (right side) and select "Save Image As..."
4. Save as `icon.png` in your project root directory

### Step 2: Convert PNG to ICO
1. Go to https://convertICO.com
2. Upload your new `icon.png` file
3. Click "Convert to ICO"
4. Download the ICO file
5. Save it as `build/icons/win/icon.ico`

### Step 3: Test Your New Icon
1. Close any running instances of your application
2. Run `npm start`
3. Check the taskbar - you should now see your custom icon instead of the default Electron icon

## Why This Will Work
- Your new icon design without text will appear larger and cleaner
- A proper ICO file with valid image data will display correctly in the taskbar
- The application is already configured to use this path

## Troubleshooting
If you still see the default Electron icon:
1. Close the application completely
2. Restart Windows Explorer (Task Manager > Processes > Windows Explorer > Restart)
3. Or reboot your computer
4. Run the application again

## Benefits
- Your custom icon will replace the default Electron icon
- The icon without text will appear significantly larger
- More professional appearance in the taskbar
