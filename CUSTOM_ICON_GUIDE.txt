FINAL STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO CREATE YOUR CUSTOM TASKBAR ICON
=========================================================

CURRENT STATUS:
- Your icon.svg has been updated to remove text (making it appear larger)
- Placeholder files have been created but won't show in the taskbar

TO CREATE A WORKING ICO FILE:
----------------------------

STEP 1: CONVERT YOUR SVG TO PNG
1. Make sure convert-svg-to-png.html is open in your browser
2. Click the "Convert to PNG" button
3. Right-click on the converted image on the right side
4. Select "Save Image As..."
5. Save as "icon.png" in your project root directory (d:\turing\log-analyzer)

STEP 2: CONVERT PNG TO ICO
1. Go to this website: https://convertICO.com
2. Click "Choose File" and select your new icon.png
3. Click "Convert to ICO"
4. Click "Download ICO file"
5. Save the downloaded file as "icon.ico"
6. Move it to: build/icons/win/icon.ico

STEP 3: REPLACE PLACEHOLDER FILES
1. Copy your icon.png to: build/icons/png/1024x1024.png
2. For macOS, you'll need an ICNS file (use https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-icns)

STEP 4: TEST YOUR NEW ICON
1. Close any running instance of your application
2. Run: npm start
3. Look at the taskbar - you should now see your custom icon!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
If you still see the default Electron icon:
1. Close the application completely
2. Restart Windows Explorer (Task Manager > Processes > Windows Explorer > Restart)
3. Or simply reboot your computer
4. Run the application again

BENEFITS OF YOUR NEW ICON:
-------------------------
✓ Larger appearance (no text making it tiny)
✓ Cleaner design
✓ Professional look
✓ Better brand recognition

IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------
- The ICO file must contain valid image data to show in the taskbar
- A minimal or placeholder ICO file will be loaded but not displayed
- Windows caches icons, so you may need to restart Explorer or reboot
